# SHOP

It's an old programme I have written on my java classes a while back.

I decided to put it on git, so I won't lose it.

I am not the author of the interface. It was some kid of guideline our tutor prepared for us to implement.

This one was supposed to imitate a very simple shop and handle concurrency.
